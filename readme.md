# Dnd game tracker

As a GM i need to keep track of a lot of ideas, encounters, events, rounds, party stats, itens, npcs...

# Objective

Handcode the fewest as possible to track my dnd tables. So I will create a dozen of classes and use [Dnd5eapi](https://www.dnd5eapi.co/) to get the rest.

# 1.0.0

Creating my classes and functions with the 1.0 Tracker I want to use just jupyter notebooks for running the code to help me out during the sessions and a database for homebrew itens and npcs.

## Game Example

### Game Notebook

### Possible Encounters Notebook

### Creation notebook

# 2.0.0

Maybe someday i will do a website but the focus is to create some notebooks and a database to keep track of my dnd tables.
