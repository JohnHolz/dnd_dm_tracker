- NPCs names, itens, gold rewarded, apearence. Some frase used by someone.

# Dice System

From the dice system we will need a Roll dice function working. Like

    roll('1d6+2') # -> random int between 1-6 plus 2

We need too:

1.  default random mean rolls:

        10*d10+10 -> 60
        10*d6 +10 -> 45
        10*d4 +10 -> 35

2.  random default value rolls:

        start_gold: 20*d8 + 20 -> 110
        human+hp: lvl*d6 + 10 -> lvl*3.5+10

# Items

### Unique Shield example:

      {
         "index": "animated-shield",
         "name": "Animated Shield",
         "equipment_category": {
            "index": "armor",
            "name": "Armor",
            "url": "/api/equipment-categories/armor"
        },
         "desc": [
            "Armor (shield), very rare (requires attunement)",
            "While holding this shield, you can speak its command word as a bonus action to cause it to animate. The shield leaps into the air and hovers in your space to protect you as if you were wielding it, leaving your hands free. The shield remains animated for 1 minute, until you use a bonus action to end this effect, or until you are incapacitated or die, at which point the shield falls to the ground or into your hand if you have one free."
            ]
        }

### Unique Sword example:

      {
      	"index": "flame-tongue",
      	"name": "Flame Tongue",
      	"equipment_category": {
            "index": "weapon",
            "name": "Weapon",
            "url": "/api/equipment-categories/weapon"
         },
         "desc": [
            "Weapon (any sword), rare (requires attunement)",
            "You can use a bonus action to speak this magic sword's command word, causing flames to erupt from the blade. These flames shed bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet. While the sword is ablaze, it deals an extra 2d6 fire damage to any target it hits. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or sheathe the sword."
         ]
      }


### Encounter:

Encounters I want to let as a database of ideas of encounters.
A class that:

1.  Init the class with simple ideas to been completed as you want.
2.  Keep the important information of a possible already planned encounter.
3.  Ease to find the encounter that the DM needs at the moment (finding by location, rewards, enemies).
