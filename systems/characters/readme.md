# Characters/Players:

The char class need just to keep the most important info of our party. So I will just keep what I use in my day by day. But with time maybe I will implement a whole character sheet.

- Passive Perception
- Magical Itens
- AC
- HP
- Some spells slots

### NPCs

NPC class are to keep important npcs, npcs itens, gold, lore and to create random npcs to us.
