### 2. Encounter:
   Encounters I want to let as a database of ideas of encounters. 
   A class that: 
   1. Init the class with simple ideas to been completed as you want.  
   2. Keep the important information of a possible already planned encounter.   
   3. Ease to find the encounter that the DM needs at the moment (finding by location, rewards, enemies).
