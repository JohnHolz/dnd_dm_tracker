# Players Folder

This folder is for all the open information about the world and the rules.

## Rules

The Rules file describe all the diferent rules that I use. All other mechenics are in the core rule books, if you disagree with some rule talk to me and we can change together.

## World
The character need to know about the world he was raised, the core things I am writing on are:
1. The World himself, nations, races, groups...
2. The village or city and near by that they are raised. But not just the place, legends, histories, corrupt places, maybe bad guards.
3. Groups/Factions
4. Race and class knowledge. If you are a dragonborn you know what are Abishai, if you are a cleric too. But a Human fighter maybe never heard before.
